        <!--we use bookmarks to direct to the links in a large webpage-->
          <a href="#Browser">Details</a>

            1. Entering a Web Address

            You type a URL like https://www.wikipedia.org in your browser.</br></br></br></br>

           That URL tells the browser where the webpage is located on the internet.</br></br></br></br>
             </br></br></br></br></br></br>
            2. DNS Lookup

         The browser asks the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the human-friendly name (wikipedia.org) into an IP address (like 208.80.154.224) so it knows which server to contact.</br></br></br></br>

            3. Browser Sends a Request

         The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server at that IP address asking for the webpage files.
            </br></br></br></br></br></br>
            4. Web Server Responds

         The server receives the request and sends back the webpageâ€™s code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).

         Think of it like a restaurant: you (browser) order food (webpage) from the waiter (server), and the kitchen (backend system) prepares it.
         </br></br></br></br></br></br>
         <h3 id="Browser">Browser details</h3>
         5. Browser Renders the Webpage

         The browser reads the HTML first (the structure of the page).

         Then it applies CSS (to style fonts, colors, layout).

         Finally, it runs JavaScript (to add interactivity like dropdown menus, forms, animations).

          Images, videos, and other content are also loaded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>

         6. You See the Webpage

         Once all resources are downloaded and processed, the webpage is displayed on your screen.
           </br></br></br></br>
          If the page is interactive, you can click buttons, fill forms, or navigate to other pages.
